A10 Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)


What is CSRF?
-> CSRF stands for Cross-site Request Forgery
-> Using the session id of a particular site stored in the cookie,
   Hackers can force the browser to send it automatically to the target site.
-> The session is already secure, but the problem is automatic attachment with other sites.
-> By defualt Spring Security will take care of it.
-> There are multiple ways of handling it, one of the way is:
-> What if with every request you get back in return is a token. So that next time
   If you send the request then you have to submit the token as well.
-> Out of GET, POST, PUT, DELETE Http requests GET is the most safest as you are not change the data
   on the server side.
   By default Spring Security will enforces CSRF on PUT, POST, DELETE, PATCH but not on GET, HEAD
   OPTIONS.


SameSite --> strict
-> The earlier issue with Csrf Was that session id could is accessed from other sites by manipulating
   browser requests.
   But SameSite is a cookie-level protection that tells the browser. Do not send this cookie on
   cross site requests.

   There are 3 different values to this.
   lax : Cookie sent on top-level GET navigations
   Strict : Cookie sent when url origin matches exactly
   None : Cookie sent everywhere.
